### Wireframes

Here are a set of Wireframes that I have constructed towards the design process, I have created two layouts one for [desktop](https://github.com/Tamaraa-M/ClickSnap-Photography/tree/master/wireframes/desktop) and one for [mobile](https://github.com/Tamaraa-M/ClickSnap-Photography/tree/master/wireframes/mobile). These wireframes show the structure and elements for each page and how the website functions.
