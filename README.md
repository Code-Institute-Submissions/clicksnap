### Wireframes

These wireframes show the structure and elements for each page and how the website functions.

### Bugs 

__Fixed Issues__
- When the map code has been editied an error message shows up even though the map still functions as normal
   - Fix: Change error message display to none in CSS
- Gallery Page - Image Slideshow Images not loading
   - Fix: Remove "/" from the start of each file path. The file path in the html was using absolute file paths, rather than relative. 
- Schedule Page - Click ‘Download Full Month’ button - Error ‘Download Failed No File’
    - Fix: Remove “/” from the start of the file path.

__Pending Issues__
- On Samusung 21.5” Touchscreen All in One PC (Chrome Browser) - On the Gallery Page and Contact page, when the ‘email’ link is clicked there is no response.
  - Not sure where the issue is coming from. It works on all the other devices I have tested.
- W3 Vailidator Warning - "The date input type is not supported in all browsers. Please be sure to test, and consider using a polyfill."
  - I have tested this in the browsers I have previously mentioned and it works fine on all apart from Internet Explorer. 
- Internet Explorer - Images on Gallery page stretch, Date of Birth calendar is not supported, Telephone link doesn’t work.
  - Had a discussion regarding Internet Explorer issues with 'Tutor Support' and was told not to worry about Internet Explorer as it is largely deprecated and this project wouldn’t be tested on it. 
- Firefox Mobile and Desktop - Loading the website is much slower than other browsers, images take a while to load and images from gallery start out pixelated until the site finishes loading.
  - Not sure where the issue is coming from.
- Ipad Pro (Chrome Developer Tools) - On the Gallery, Schedule and Contact pages; the footer is not sat at the bottom of the page as it should be.
  - This issue still needs to be approched but due to the time frame I have considered this as a low severity due to this problem only being on one device.


### Screen and Device sizes

__From 1256px__

- Contact Page
  - Map disappears - at this screen size it starts to overlap. (I didn’t want to incorporate it elsewhere on the page as I didn’t want to overcrowd the space, keeping the design clean.)

__From 1199 - 577__
- Navigation tabs - Pushed to stay centred in the browser screen.

- Hero Images - At this screen size all hero images on the Home, Schedule and About Pages; outer edges get cut off, but the centre of the image still remains the focus point.

- __Home Page:__
- Introduction, About, Price List sections - Columns stack into 3 rows.
- Section Headings - Top padding added to give more space between the information and hero image.
- Section Dividers - Dividers are added between each information section to separate the content and give it a clearer and cleaner look.

- __Gallery Page:__
- Image slideshow - At this screen size the outer edges get cut off, but this doesn’t affect how the pictures are viewed, keeping the focal point of the images in focus.
- Information section - Margin and padding added. Due to short content the footer wasn't being pushed down enough.

- __Schedule Page:__
-  Weekly Timetable - At this screen size the table width adjusts so that it can still be visible.

__From 577px - 500px__
- __Contact Page:__
- Address and contact form - Div positions are swapped so that it was more responsive. It felt more natural to have the form become the first section you see before scrolling down to the address when on a smaller device. At this screen size the form started to overlap with the address. 
- Section Divider - Added a divider to separate the content and give it a clearer and cleaner look.

__From 500px__
- Banner - Size reduced to fit better on mobile screens.
- Logo - Reduce font size, collapse text so ‘ClickSnap’ now sits on top of “Photography’ for a more refined look.
- Navigation Tab Menu - Changes to the mobile navigation button.

- __Home Page:__
- Price List - Cards stack into three rows.
- Copywrite - Size reduced and position moved from the centre to the left.

- __Gallery:__
- Image slideshow - Size has been reduced so that it takes up the appropriate amount of space for mobile screens.
- Image slideshow Info - Student Name and Photography Title font sizes have been reduced. Image descriptions have been removed in order to not obscure the images.
- Gallery Info - Line breaks have been removed, so that the text can flow nicely with the screen size.

- __Schedule:__ 
- Download Full Month button - Size has been reduced to fit the smaller screen size.
